# Employee Tracker 

## Refactor
- This project consisted of refactoring starter code for the code to run correctly.
- I added an empty array so that Employees can Enter as many names and salaries as they have in the company, so that the code can use that information to display the average salary of the employees of the company. 
- Using a while loop allowed me to add multiple window prompts so that the computer can gather the information that it needs to display what we want. In this case, we want a first name, last name, and salary, so that it can calculate the average salary between the empoyees.
- I then created a function to add all of the employee salaries and divide it by the amount of employees within the array, to then get our average employee salary within the company. 
- Lastly, created another function to select a random employee. I created a variable and a function, and within that functin, I used Math.floor to round any decimals down to the nearest integer, and then used Math.random to select a random employee within the amount of employees in the array.

## Installation 

- This project provided me with starter code in HTML and CSS, and also provided a little bit of starter code in JavaScript that I was instructed to not modify. 
- I refactored the code in JavaScript to get the final project. 

## Usage 

- This project will will deploy a refactored code that will show a functioning Employee Tracker. 

## Contributing

- I worked with several of my classmates within the bootcamp to refactor my code. We have several study groups that were a massive help.
